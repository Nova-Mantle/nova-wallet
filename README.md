> **"The AI Brain for Your Crypto Wallets. Chat, Transact, and Onboard Users Instantly on Lisk."**

## 🎯 Why Nova AI?

**"UX Friction is Killing Adoption."** Most Web3 wallets are built for experts, not humans. Users are forced to learn crypto before they can act, leading to three critical failures:

* **High Abandonment Rate:** **65%** of new users abandon dApps after their very first interaction due to overwhelming interface complexity.
* **The 23-Minute Barrier:** The average first transaction takes **~23 minutes** to complete, creating massive friction compared to the seconds it takes in Web2 apps.
* **Cognitive Overload:** Fragmented chains and unpredictable gas fees increase cognitive overhead, causing user retention to drop below **1%** after just 30 days.

## 💡 Our Solution: The AI Orchestration Layer

Nova AI is **not a new wallet**. It is an intelligent interface layer that sits on top of your existing wallets (MetaMask, Phantom, etc.), allowing you to interact with the Lisk blockchain using natural language.

## 💎 Key Features

We have built a suite of AI-powered modules designed for Real-World Utility.

### 1. Nova Conversational Interface (Chat-to-Transact)

The core of Nova AI is a chat-first interface powered by LLMs. Instead of navigating complex menus, users simply "chat" with their assets. The AI interprets intents, constructs transactions, and presents a clear preview card for user approval.

* **Natural Language Execution:** Type "Send 10 LSK to 0x489..." or "Check my portfolio balance," and Nova executes it instantly.
* **Wallet Agnostic:** Works as an orchestrator for your existing MetaMask or EVM wallets.
* **Context-Aware:** The AI understands context (e.g., distinguishing between "Testnet" and "Mainnet" requests).

### 2. Nova Paylink (Fiat-to-Crypto Bridge)

A "Real World Utility" feature designed for the gig economy. Nova Paylink enables users to create invoices/payment links that accept Fiat but settle in Crypto on Lisk.

* **Global & Local Rails:** Integrated with **Transak** (Global Cards) and **Midtrans** (Indonesian QRIS/Bank Transfer).
* **Seamless Settlement:** Clients pay in IDR/USD, and the freelancer receives USDT or LSK directly in their wallet.
* **Instant Generation:** Create a payment link via chat command: *"Create paylink for 0.00000000001 eth"*.

### 3. Predictive Insights & Portfolio Aggregation

Nova AI doesn't just execute; it informs. Before any action, our agents analyze on-chain data to ensure users make optimal decisions.

* **Smart Gas Prediction:** AI analyzes network congestion on Lisk to recommend the best time to transact.
* **Multi-Chain Portfolio:** Aggregates balances across Lisk and other EVM chains in a single view, eliminating the need to check multiple explorers.
* **Transaction Simulation:** Prevents errors by showing a human-readable summary of what will happen before you sign.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Nova AI operates on a **"Hexa-Core Agent System"** powered by CopilotKit and Lisk RPC. The architecture ensures that user intents are routed to specific specialized agents for maximum accuracy.

**How it works on Lisk:**
1. **User Input:** Natural language prompt enters the Router.
2. **Agent Selection:** Router activates the specific agent (e.g., Paylink Agent for invoices).
3. **Lisk Interaction:** Agents communicate with Lisk L2 RPC nodes (using viem/wagmi) to fetch data or prepare transaction objects.
4. **Response:** The UI renders a "Smart Card" (not just text) for the user to confirm the on-chain action.
